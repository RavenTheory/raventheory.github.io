<!-- Modern Particle Physics by Mark Thomson is a detailed, modern introduction to particle physics, aimed at advanced undergraduates and early graduate students. It covers the foundations of the Standard Model, experimental methods, and key concepts such as gauge theories and electroweak unification. A clear and concept-driven approach with a balance between theory and experimental evidence. -->

One of the best textbooks I've read. Very accessible and the writing is so good it makes reading fun and easy even if the topics might not necessarily be easy.
