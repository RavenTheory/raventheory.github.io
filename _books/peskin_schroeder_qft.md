I cannot really compare this to other QFT books---there are many that are recommended by people---but from my experience I really liked this. 
Great book, learning QFT was fun with this book, although in some derivations/examples I would have appreciated having more detail.
(There were like one or two instances for this, so it's not like there aren't adequate explanations in this book.)
