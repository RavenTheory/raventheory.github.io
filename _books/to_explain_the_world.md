I like the writing style of this book.
So far I have read almost half of it, but my reading has been a bit slow since I started to do copywork.
I've probably spent more time copying this book than reading it even if I have read three times the amount I've copied.

I certainly would recommend this book to anyone that is interested in science and history of sciences.
