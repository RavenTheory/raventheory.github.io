My Electrodynamics course was based on this, but to be honest I didn't read as much of this book as I should've had.
I did read more in the latter parts of the book though, and I liked how it was written there, so overall I think this should be a good book.
I know it's a bit funny to put that I've finished reading this book, but the topics I kinda did I guess.
