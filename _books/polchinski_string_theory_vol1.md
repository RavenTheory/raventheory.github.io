I have very recently started to study this book.
I've been curious about string theory, but never really dipped my toe into it.
Now, I am determined to learn about it even if it's not via more structured approach of learning via enrolling into a course.
I plan to follow one of the sequences showed mentioned in Preface chapter, with the amount of topics corresponding to two quarters long course.
Currently, I am studying chapter 1.
