Great book, 100% recommend to anyone and everyone.
During my master's studies I began to know more about Dirac as I learned about particle physics and quantum field theory, and during this time I became interested in his personality and physics.
This book was perfect for me, who was curious about Dirac, and I can now say that he is probably the physicist I most look up to.

This biography is very interesting and well written, I'm not really a book reviewer, so I don't know what else to say, lol.
