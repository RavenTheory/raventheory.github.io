I have studied the first three parts of this book in good detail, and done most of the exercises. Currently, study of this book is on hiatus, since the first three parts more than filled what I was looking from Group Theory.
I was looking to review and supplement the group theory topics I learned in my mathematics course (FYMM IIIa), and so far I have covered more group theory topics than were in my course.
I do plan on continuing studying this book in the future, but currently I am looking to expand my knowledge in other areas of physics and mathematics. 


As for the review of the book, I'm not really a reviewer, but I do like the book, the content is dense, and the examples are great, and I liked doing the exercises even if there were many of them.
