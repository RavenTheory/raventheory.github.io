There are many options, and the first one I was interested in was True NAS scale, since it is a NAS (Network Attached Storage) operating system with ability to run Docker containers—meaning it has more functionality than just being a NAS. While I did begin my journey from curiosity about NAS systems, I wanted to build something more than just a NAS, and use a Linux server not only to customize it for my needs but also to learn more about how Linux servers work.</p> <p>The first Linux distribution I considered using was Debian, since it is a stable distribution fit for servers, and it was the Linux distribution I saw mentioned the most when doing my research, along with Ubuntu which is based on Debian. (Most recommendations for new users, especially on YouTube, were Ubuntu, but I also didn’t want to use it and Debian seemed to be used more, although that might have just been Reddit being Reddit.) At first, I was set on trying Debian, but I thought to myself: “While Debian is stable and all, I want to try something more exciting, more cutting edge, since stability isn’t a concern for me.”</p> <p>At the same time I had wanted to test a Linux distribution by openSUSE, so I integrated that goal into my home server project and made a list of distributions to test for potential home server use:</p> <ol> <li>openSUSE Leap</li> <li>Fedora server</li> <li>Debian</li> </ol> <p>I would start by trying Leap, and if something didn’t work—or I just didn’t like it—I would move on to Fedora and if that wasn’t good either, I would fall back to Debian.</p> <p>While I wanted more cutting edge (and I am less concerned about the stability thing as I am writing now than when I decided to test these), I ended up being more conservative, since I am new to doing this stuff, and picked the stable Leap instead of the rolling Tumbleweed, since servers are supposed to update less frequently as I learned on the internet. My choice of Fedora did reflect my desire for more cutting edge, but I also chose Fedora since I use Fedora desktop on my computer, and I was curious about the server side of the same distribution. As for Debian, it was a fall-back option, though I cannot say if I would have just went to try out something else instead. (After all, currently I can imagine wanting to try more exotic things such as rolling release distribution.)</p> <p>So, I downloaded openSUSE Leap and installed it into a virtual machine (VM) on my PC. From initial limited experience, I quite liked it. Even though I had to adjust to working with a server instead of a desktop environment, it was fun to learn about things like connecting to the server via SSH from outside the VM. I set up Docker, Portainer, and a Minecraft server using Portainer. This process was flawless, and I enjoyed it, but I couldn’t get Cockpit, a web-based remote administration software, working. And this was critical, because I really wanted to use this tool—so much so that it was one of the reasons why I chose Fedora as my second option—to manage the server from my PC.</p> <p>After light research and not finding a solution, I guessed that maybe there was some problem with using a VM and trying to connect to it via network—even though this was a bit of an unlikely scenario, as both Portainer web interface and Minecraft server LAN connection were working. Having guessed that, I set out to install Leap into my very old (probably over 20 years old at this point) Dell OptiPlex 360.</p> <p>After some difficulties—to put it mildly—with my network (completely the fault of my terrible router given by my ISP) I lost a day of my life along with some sleep. Somehow, though, I was randomly able to connect to the network the next day. I once again tried to use Cockpit and failed. So it wasn’t the VM that was the issue. After doing some research I found out that I’m not the only one with this issue and concluded that Cockpit just didn’t work with Leap. Since it was a critical component of my server plans, I decided to move on to Fedora.</p> <p>Currently, I am testing Fedora server, and it has been satisfactory, so I am thinking of continuing to use it for the foreseeable future. Switching to Fedora wasn’t all rainbows and sunshine either, because of SELinux. SELinux is a kernel security model I’m not too familiar with, but from what I understand, it increases security of the system. When it comes to computers, more security usually (always?) comes with some trade-off and for me that was Docker.</p> <p>I didn’t know about SELinux at first, so my attempts at making a Minecraft server Docker container using an image failed. It refused to download the server or the mods no matter what version I put in the environment variable. After failing to fix the Docker issue, I decided to use Podman, an alternative to Docker from Red Hat that works natively in Fedora—and work it did. I quickly got Minecraft server set up, and now I can start it with a few clicks from Cockpit web interface.</p> <p>So, the reason I am using Fedora is that I didn’t want to use a NAS operating system, even though my journey started by learning about NAS, Debian seemed too “boring” for my needs and openSUSE Leap didn’t work for me because I wanted to use Cockpit, and I was already familiar with using Fedora on my desktop, and I’ve had good experience with Fedora so far.</p> <p>Update: As I’m writing this on 03/05/2025, I learned about Leap 16.0 that’s been released as beta a few days ago. It has some major changes including having Cockpit and support for parallel package downloads in Zypper, the package manager. When this comes out I might try this again and even migrate to it. (Although I might just stick with what I have working currently, one never knows what will happen.)</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="home-server"/><category term="linux"/><category term="server"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I explain why I chose to use Fedora for my home server]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">My first blog</title><link href="https://raventheory.github.io/blog/2025/First-Blog/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My first blog"/><published>2025-05-03T23:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-03T23:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://raventheory.github.io/blog/2025/First-Blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://raventheory.github.io/blog/2025/First-Blog/"><![CDATA[<p>So, this is my first blog post that I am writing. (Technically <a href="/blog/2025/why-I-chose-fedora/">Why I chose Fedora for my home server</a> was written a day before this, but nothing is published while I’m writing this.) As a person I am not very outgoing, and I’ve often felt that expressing my thoughts publicly is a bit pointless and waste of energy. But I want to get more comfortable sharing them, so I’ve started writing these blog posts.</p> <p>The biggest reason I decided to start writing is to improve my overall writing skills. I have never been satisfied with my writing, but didn’t do much to improve it, since it didn’t really matter, until I had to write my Master’s thesis. When writing my thesis I found out how bad my writing had become: it had no flow or structure, my thinking was fragmented, I was unsure how to connect topics across paragraphs, and writing good sentences was very difficult.</p> <p>Now, just writing whatever and refining it into a blog post isn’t really a great way to improve writing—even if one has good reading comprehension and is able to recognise the quality of writing—since even if one recognises good writing, it’s hard to produce one without targeted practice. Currently, my plan has been to learn to write using the olden ways of copywork, where one simply copies the work of others.</p> <p>When I was looking for methods to improve my writing, I came across copywork from a Reddit post, where the following <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/want-to-become-a-better-writer-copy-the-work-of-others/">article</a> was linked in comments. Reading this article convinced me to start copywork, and so far I have copied about 18 A4-pages of <em>To Explain The World</em> by Steven Weinberg using the London method mentioned in the article.</p> <p>After a single week of copywork, my writing had evolved enough for me to notice immediately. After the first week, though, I haven’t felt my writing improve that much, which might have to do with me not being as consistent on writing due to my recent carpal tunnel syndrome problems. (This has also slowed my progress with learning about computers and my independent physics studies for a while, but this is not a blog post about my nerves being terrorists.)</p> <p>Anyway, I am hoping that writing blog posts can become a benchmark of sorts for my writing progress, and give me ideas on how to best share thoughts in writing form. Maybe they will even make me more conversational and opinionated—but I doubt that. I am happy to just improve my writing. After all, my favourite quote is from the one and only P.A.M. Dirac, whom I very much look up to: “There are always more people who prefer to speak than to listen.”</p> <p>Apart from getting better at writing in a more structured way and sharing my thoughts, I also want to open up a bit, showcase what I do, and hopefully share my passion for physics—though I’m not sure if I’ll be writing much or at all about physics here. (I get bored very easily, so I might just forget about this website.)</p> <p>Anyway, this is my first blog post, so I should probably write more than just why I started this blog—like my motivations for the website and what I might potentially write about. The primary motivation behind this website is that I wanted to make one. Originally, I thought it would be cool to host a website on my home server, but then I found out about GitHub Pages, and it seemed too good not to use.</p> <p>I am not quite sure what I want to write in this website, since—as mentioned earlier—I am quite reserved and private person, so sharing things doesn’t come naturally. (Also, I don’t really do much cool stuff currently that would be fun to write about). So, the most things I write in these posts will probably be accompanying my projects at the <a href="/projects">project page</a>.</p> <p>One thing I do want to write about in the future is my love for physics and how amazing it is, and maybe also share my story of how, after a bit of a slump during Covid days, I rediscovered this love for physics again. Quantum field theory (QFT) was a huge part of this—it’s a phenomenal and beautiful theory, after all—so maybe I’ll also write about how fascinating learning QFT truly was for me. (Though, at this point, I might’ve forgotten most of the details due to poor memory, lol.) Physics really is awesome, and I do hope I get to continue working on it.</p> <p>Well, this is what I want out from this website and blog. For now, it’s just a test on making websites using Jekyll. (I have irrational hate for HTML, so Jekyll is quite nice.) And this website is a neat portfolio of sorts with my CV, projects and bookshelf showing what I’m doing or reading. Hopefully, in the future, I’ll also write about the topics mentioned above, but let’s see how that goes.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing"/><category term="writing"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little blog post]]></summary></entry></feed>
