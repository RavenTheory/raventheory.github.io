So, this is my first blog post that I am writing. (Technically [Why I chose Fedora for my home server](/blog/2025/why-I-chose-fedora/) was written a day before this, but nothing is published while I'm writing this.) As a person I am not very outgoing, and I’ve often felt that expressing my thoughts publicly is a bit pointless and waste of energy. But I want to get more comfortable sharing them, so I’ve started writing these blog posts. 

The biggest reason I decided to start writing is to improve my overall writing skills. I have never been satisfied with my writing, but didn’t do much to improve it, since it didn’t really matter, until I had to write my Master’s thesis. When writing my thesis I found out how bad my writing had become: it had no flow or structure, my thinking was fragmented, I was unsure how to connect topics across paragraphs, and writing good sentences was very difficult.

Now, just writing whatever and refining it into a blog post isn’t really a great way to improve writing---even if one has good reading comprehension and is able to recognise the quality of writing---since even if one recognises good writing, it’s hard to produce one without targeted practice. Currently, my plan has been to learn to write using the olden ways of copywork, where one simply copies the work of others.

When I was looking for methods to improve my writing, I came across copywork from a Reddit post, where the following [article](https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/want-to-become-a-better-writer-copy-the-work-of-others/) was linked in comments. Reading this article convinced me to start copywork, and so far I have copied about 18 A4-pages of *To Explain The World* by Steven Weinberg using the London method mentioned in the article.

After a single week of copywork, my writing had evolved enough for me to notice immediately. After the first week, though, I haven’t felt my writing improve that much, which might have to do with me not being as consistent on writing due to my recent carpal tunnel syndrome problems. (This has also slowed my progress with learning about computers and my independent physics studies for a while, but this is not a blog post about my nerves being terrorists.) 

Anyway, I am hoping that writing blog posts can become a benchmark of sorts for my writing progress, and give me ideas on how to best share thoughts in writing form. Maybe they will even make me more conversational and opinionated---but I doubt that. I am happy to just improve my writing. After all, my favourite quote is from the one and only P.A.M. Dirac, whom I very much look up to: “There are always more people who prefer to speak than to listen.”

Apart from getting better at writing in a more structured way and sharing my thoughts, I also want to open up a bit, showcase what I do, and hopefully share my passion for physics---though I’m not sure if I’ll be writing much or at all about physics here. (I get bored very easily, so I might just forget about this website.)

Anyway, this is my first blog post, so I should probably write more than just why I started this blog---like my motivations for the website and what I might potentially write about. The primary motivation behind this website is that I wanted to make one. Originally, I thought it would be cool to host a website on my home server, but then I found out about GitHub Pages, and it seemed too good not to use.

I am not quite sure what I want to write in this website, since---as mentioned earlier---I am quite reserved and private person, so sharing things doesn’t come naturally. (Also, I don’t really do much cool stuff currently that would be fun to write about). So, the most things I write in these posts will probably be accompanying my projects at the [project page](/projects). 

One thing I do want to write about in the future is my love for physics and how amazing it is, and maybe also share my story of how, after a bit of a slump during Covid days, I rediscovered this love for physics again. Quantum field theory (QFT) was a huge part of this---it’s a phenomenal and beautiful theory, after all---so maybe I’ll also write about how fascinating learning QFT truly was for me. (Though, at this point, I might’ve forgotten most of the details due to poor memory, lol.) Physics really is awesome, and I do hope I get to continue working on it.

Well, this is what I want out from this website and blog. For now, it’s just a test on making websites using Jekyll. (I have irrational hate for HTML, so Jekyll is quite nice.) And this website is a neat portfolio of sorts with my CV, projects and bookshelf showing what I’m doing or reading. Hopefully, in the future, I’ll also write about the topics mentioned above, but let’s see how that goes.
