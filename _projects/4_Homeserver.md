My fascination with computers and watching dozens of tech videos on NAS systems and home servers has gotten me interested in building my own home server.
While *home server* sounds grand and expensive, building one yourself is quite simple and inexpensive---especially when starting and trying stuff out.
All you need is any piece of computer hardware you can find be it 20 years old Dell OptiPlex or a second hand pc from decade ago that you can find online for cheap, or just a laptop you have lying around.
This low barrier of entry along with the vast world of open source software got me into actually building a home server.


For more details on why I chose Fedora server as my operating system see my post [Why I chose Fedora for my home server](/blog/2025/why-I-chose-fedora/)



My current plans/ideas for home server are the following:

    - NAS (samba share has been configured in the test machine)
    - Minecraft server (a test server has been succesfully setup)
    - Photo backups (Immich maybe)
    - Maybe some next cloud things (I haven't looked much into it)
    - Maybe syncthings for some stuff too (not sure)
    - Could do media hosting like jellyfin, but I am not sure about that right now
    - Private VPN using wireguard, but this will be one of the least prioritized for now
    - Servers for some other games if necessary based on what my friend group will be playing
    - Docker stuff (podman stuff actually since im in fedora now)
    - I am also interested in Network stuff like multi WAN setups, but probably not gonna happen even due to time and other constraints



I have some ideas on what write here to complete this page, but I have some other stuff to focus on currently.
