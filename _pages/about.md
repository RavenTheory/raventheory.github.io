I am a Master's graduate from University of Helsinki, specializing in particle physics and cosmology.
I am interested in fundamental physics and computers.

During master's I have learned the two fundamental theories of physics: quantum field theory and general relativity.
My interest in general relativity and curiosity towards differential geometry led me to my thesis [Junction conditions in general relativity](http://hdl.handle.net/10138/585536).
Currently, I am interested in continuing my path towards high energy physics and have started to study string theory.

I am also seeking PhD opportunities and am interested in areas ranging from high-energy particle physics and string theory to cosmology, including black hole physics and theoretical aspects of quantum gravity, and condensed matter physics. 


[comment]: Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

[comment]: Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

[comment]: Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
